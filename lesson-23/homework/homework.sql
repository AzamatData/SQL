--Puzzle 1: In this puzzle you have to extract the month from the dt column and then append zero single digit month 
--if any. Please check out sample input and expected output.
--Input Table: Dates
--solution:
select *
	,case when len(DATEPART(Month, DT))=1 then CONCAT('0',DATEPART(Month, DT))
		else cast(DATEPART(Month, DT) as varchar(2))
	end as MonthPrefixedWithZero 
from Dates;

--Puzzle 2: In this puzzle you have to find out the unique Ids present in the table. You also have to find out 
--the SUM of Max values of vals columns for each Id and RId. For more details please see the sample input and 
--expected output.
--solution:

SELECT TOP 1 
	
	SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT Id)) OVER() Distinct_Ids 
	,rid
	,SUM(MAX(Vals)) OVER() TotalOfMaxVals

FROM MyTabel
GROUP BY Id,rid;

--Puzzle 3: In this puzzle you have to get records with at least 6 characters and maximum 10 characters. 
--Please see the sample input and expected output.
--solution:

select * from TestFixLengths
where LEN(Vals) between 6 and 10

--Puzzle 4: In this puzzle you have to find the maximum value for each Id and then get the Item for that Id and 
--Maximum value. Please check out sample input and expected output.
--solution:

select ID, Item, Vals 
from(
	select *
	,row_number() OVER(Partition by ID order by Vals desc) as rnk
	from TestMaximum)  as tbl1
where tbl1.rnk=1;

--Puzzle 5: In this puzzle you have to first find the maximum value for each Id and DetailedNumber, and 
--then Sum the data using Id only. Please check out sample input and expected output.
--solution
select distinct id
	,SUM(MAX(Vals)) OVER(partition by ID) as SumOfMax
from SumOfMax
group by id, DetailedNumber;

--Puzzle 6: In this puzzle you have to find difference between a and b column between each row and if 
--the difference is not equal to 0 then show the difference i.e. a â€“ b otherwise 0. Now you need to replace this 
--zero with blank.Please check the sample input and the expected output.
--Solution: 
select *
	, case when [a]-[b]<>0 then cast(a-b as varchar(30))
	else ''
	end as output
